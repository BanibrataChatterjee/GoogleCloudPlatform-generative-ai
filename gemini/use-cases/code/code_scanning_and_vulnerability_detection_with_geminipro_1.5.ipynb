    "\n",
    "In today's digital landscape, software security is paramount. With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, it's more important than ever for developers to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities in their code. Vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. By harnessing the power of Gemini Pro 1.5, we can revolutionize code vulnerability detection and remediation, ensuring more robust and secure software applications"

    "1.   **Prompt engineering:** Crafting a clear and comprehensive prompt for Gemini Pro, providing instructions for code analysis and output formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **LLM invocation:** Submitting the consolidated code string to Gemini Pro 1.5 for analysis.\n",
    "2.   **Response parsing:** Extracting vulnerability information, recommendations, and code snippets from Gemini Pro's response.\n",
    "\n",
