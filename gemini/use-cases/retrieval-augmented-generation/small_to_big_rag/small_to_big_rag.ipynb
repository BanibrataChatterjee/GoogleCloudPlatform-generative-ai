    "Small-to-big RAG is a form of recursive RAG, where small chunks are connected to larger chunks (eg. a passage of a document is connected to the full document). Initially, only small chunks are retrieved during RAG. If needed, the model can request additional context, at which point the larger context can be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small-to-big RAG is a way to work around the limits of dense, meaning-rich vector embeddings, where passing in too much context can result in a loss of meeting in the vector representation.  \n",
    "(Text-embedding-gecko has a text input limit of 3,072 tokens)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Small-to-big is also a good option if you are working with long or complex documents that require context exceeding the ideal chunk size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, Small-to-big can help you optimize inference costs, especially if you're paying per token (eg. Gemini API on Vertex AI) — because if a small amount of input context is enough for the model to generate an answer, you don't have to provide the whole large document as context. Said another way - you're only paying for the number of context tokens you actually need to generate an accurate response from Gemini.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll walk through a Small-to-big RAG example using a GitHub codebase called [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). This is a microservices, polyglot sample application. We'll help a new Online Boutique user (or contributor) navigate this large codebase by providing a Q&A chatbot functionality, grounded on the codebase. \n"
