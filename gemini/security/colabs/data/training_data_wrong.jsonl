The body is described in the Standard Anatomical Position. Reference is to this position only.,2. Where necessary, injuries are numbered for reference. This is arbitrary and does not correspond to any order in which they may have been incurred. All the injuries are antemortem, unless otherwise specified.,3. The term \"anatomic\" is used as a specification to indicate correspondence with the description as set forth in the textbooks of Gross Anatomy. It denotes freedom from significant, visible or morbid alteration.,EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:, The body is that of a well developed, well nourished Caucasian male stated to be 25 years old. The body weighs 171 pounds, measuring 69 inches from crown to sole. The hair on the scalp is brown and straight. The irides appear hazel with the pupils fixed and dilated.

On the outside of the left hip region there was a 1-1/2 inch long slit-like tear. The decedent also was wearing 2 canvas type boots and 2 sweat socks.,EVIDENCE OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:,  None.,EVIDENCE OF INJURY,SHARP FORCE INJURIES OF NECK,1.  Sharp force injury of neck, left side, transecting left internal jugular vein. This sharp force injury is complex, and appears to be a combination of a stabbing and cutting wound. It begins on the left side of the neck, at the level of the midlarynx, over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle; it is gaping, measuring 3 inches in length with smooth edges. It tapers superiorly to 1 inch in length cut skin. Dissection discloses that the wound path is through the skin, the subcutaneous tissue, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle with hemorrhage along the wound path and transection of the left internal jugular vein, with dark red-purple hemorrhage in the adjacent subcutaneous tissue and fascia. The direction of the pathway is upward and slightly front to back for a distance of approximately 4 inches where it exits, post-auricular, in a 2 inch in length gaping stab/incised wound which has undulating or wavy borders, but not serrated. Intersecting the wound at right angle superior inferior is a 2 inch in length interrupted superficial, linear incised wound involving only the skin. Also, intervening between the 2 gaping stab-incised wounds is a horizontally oriented 3-1/2 inch in length interrupted superficial, linear incised wound of the skin only.  In addition, there is a 1/2 inch long, linear-triangular in size wound of the inferior portion of the left earlobe.  The direction of the sharp force injury is upward (rostral), and slightly front to back with no significant angulation or deviation. The total length of the wound path is approximately 4 inches. However, there is a 3/4 inch in length, linear, cutting or incised wound of the top or superior aspect of the pinna of the left ear; a straight metallic probe placed through the major sharp force injury shows that the injury of the superior part of the ear can be aligned with the straight metallic rod, suggesting that the 3 injuries are related; in this instance the total length of the wound path is approximately 6 inches. Also, in the left postauricular region, transversely oriented, extending from the auricular attachment laterally to the scalp is a 1-1/8 inch in length linear superficial incised skin wound.,OPINION: , This sharp force injury of the neck is fatal, associated with transection of the left internal jugular vein.,2.  Sharp force wound of the right side of neck. This is a complex injury, appearing to be a combination stabbing and cutting wound. The initial wound is present on the right side of the neck, over the sternocleidomastoid muscle, 3 inches directly below the right external auditory canal. It is diagonally oriented, and after approximation of the edges measures 5/8 inch in length; there is a pointed or tapered end inferiorly and a split or forked end superiorly approximately 1/16 inch in maximal width. Subsequent autopsy shows that the wound path is through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, without penetration of injury of a major,artery or vein; the direction is front to back and upward for a total wound path length of 2 inches and the wound exits on the right side of the back of the neck, posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle where a 2 inch long gaping incised/stab wound is evident on the skin; both ends are tapered; superiorly there is a 1 inch long superficial incised wounds extension on the skin to the back of the head; inferiorly there is a 2 inch long incised superficial skin extension, extending inferiorly towards the back of the neck. There is fresh hemorrhage and bruising along the wound path; the direction, as stated, is upward and slightly front to back.,OPINION: ,This is a nonfatal sharp force injury, with no injury or major artery or vein.,3.  At the level of the superior border of the larynx there is a transversely oriented, superficial incised wound of the neck, extending from 3 inches to the left of the anterior midline; it is 3 inches in length and involves the skin only; a small amount of cutaneous hemorrhage is evident.,OPINION:, This is a nonfatal superficial incised wound.,4.  ImmediateLY inferior and adjacent to incised wound #3 is a transversely oriented, superficial incised wound involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue; there is a small amount of dermal hemorrhage.,OPINION:, This is a nonfatal superficial incised wound.,SHARP FORCE INJURIES OF FACE,1.  There is a stab wound, involving the right earlobe; it is vertically oriented, and after approximation of the edges measures 1 inch in length with forked or split ends superiorly and inferiorly approximately 1/16 inch in total width both superior and inferior. Subsequent dissection discloses that the wound path is from right to left, in the horizontal plane for approximately 1-1/4 inches; there is fresh hemorrhage along the wound path; the wound path terminates in the left temporal bone and does not penetrate the cranial cavity.,OPINION:, This is a nonfatal stab wound.,2.  There is a group of 5 superficial incised or cutting wounds on the right side of the face, involving the right cheek and the right side of the jaw. They are varied in orientation both diagonal and horizontal; the smallest is 1/4 inch in length; the largest 5/8 inch in length. They are superficial, involving the skin only, associated with a small amount of cutaneous hemorrhage.,3.  On the back of the neck, right side, posterior to the ear and posterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle there is vertically oriented superficial incised skin wound, measuring 3/4 inch in length.,4.  There are numerous superficial incised wounds or cuts, varied in orientation, involving the skin of the right cheek, intersection and mingled with the various superficial incised wounds described above. The longest is a 3 inch long diagonally oriented superficial incised wound extending from the right side of the forehead to the cheek; various other superficial wound vary from 1/2 to 1 inch.,5.  On the right side of the cheek, adjacent to the ramus of the mandible, right, there is a 1-1/2 x 3/4 inch superficial nonpatterned red-brown abrasion with irregular border, extending superiorly towards the angle of the jaw where there are poorly defined and circumscribed abrasions adjacent to the superficial cuts or abrasions described above. It should be noted that the 5th superficial incised wound of the right side of the mandible which measures 5/8 inch in length is tapered on the posterior aspect and forked on the anterior aspect where it has a width of 1/32 inch.,6.  On the left ear, there is a superficial incised wound measuring 1/4 inch, adjacent to the posterior border of the pinna. Just below this on the inferior pinna, extending to the earlobe, there is an interrupted superficial linear abrasion measuring 1 inch in length.\n\n LABEL:"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Autopsy"}]}

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.\n\n LABEL:"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Bariatrics"}]}

Liposuction of the supraumbilical abdomen.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:,  The patient is a 31-year-old white female who previously has undergone latissimus dorsi flap and implant, breast reconstruction.  She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.  The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail.  The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed.  She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear.  At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached.  This was then opened.  The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution.  Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast.  The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form.  The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant.  The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness.  With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed.  A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed.  The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures.  The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours.  This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture.  The patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus.  A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area.  A compressive garment was placed.  The patient was then aroused from anesthesia, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Sponge, needle, lap, instrument counts were all correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.  The estimated blood loss was approximately 25 mL.\n\n LABEL:"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Bariatrics"}]}

Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed.  The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl.

His right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion from the antecubital fossa up.  Under ultrasound guidance, a #21-gauge needle was placed into his right cephalic vein.  A guidewire was then threaded through the vein and advanced without difficulty.  An introducer was then placed over the guidewire.  We attempted to manipulate the guidewire to the superior vena cava; however, we could not pass the point of the subclavian vein and we tried several maneuvers and then opted to do a venogram.  What we did was we injected approximately 4 mL of Visipaque 320 contrast material through the introducer and did a mapping venogram and it turned out that the cephalic vein was joining into the subclavian vein.  It was very tortuous area.  We made several more attempts using the mapping system to pass the glide over that area, but we were unable to do that.  Decision was made at that point then to just do a midline catheter.  The catheter was cut to 20 cm, then we inserted back to the introducer.  The introducer was removed.  The catheter was secured by two #3-0 silk sutures.  Appropriate imaging was then taken.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure nicely and was discharged from Angiography in satisfactory condition back to the general floor.  We may make another attempt in the near future using a different approach.,\n\n LABEL:"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Cardiovascular / Pulmonary"}]}

Atropine 0.25 mg was given intravenously eight minutes into the dobutamine infusion.  The resting electrocardiogram reveals a regular sinus rhythm with heart rate of 86 beats per minute, QS pattern in leads V1 and V2, and diffuse nonspecific T wave abnormality.  The heart rate increased from 86 beats per minute to 155 beats per minute, which is about 90% of the maximum predicted target heart rate.  The blood pressure increased from 130/80 to 160/70.  A maximum of 1 mm J-junctional depression was seen with fast up sloping ST segments during dobutamine infusion.  No ischemic ST segment changes were seen during dobutamine infusion or during the recovery process.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,  Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging was carried out with 10.9 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  Dobutamine infusion myocardial perfusion imaging and gated scan were carried out with 29.2 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  The lung heart ratio is 0.36.

The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.\n\n LABEL:"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Cardiovascular / Pulmonary"}]}

A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion.  Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic.  The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff.  This was nondominant.  Several catheters were used.  Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used.  A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve.  Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast.  Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve.  Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results.  There were no complications.  He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Right coronary artery:  This has an unusual high anterior takeoff.  The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.,2.  Left main trunk:  A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.,3.  Left anterior descending:  Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing.  The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.,4.  Circumflex:  Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal.  After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk.  The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.,5.  Left ventriculogram:  Normal volume in diastole and systole.  Normal systolic function is present.  There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.,DIAGNOSES,1.  Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch.  Dominant circumflex system.  Severe disease of the posterior descending.  Mild left main trunk disease.,2.  Normal left ventricular systolic function.,Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery.  The patient also has severe disease of the circumflex which is dominant.  This anatomy is not appropriate for percutaneous intervention.

There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a \"tissue pledget\" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.\n\n LABEL:"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Cardiovascular / Pulmonary"}]}

The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery and vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin.  The pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, a #6 French arterial sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was flushed.  Next, an angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under the direct fluoroscopy visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The catheter was then guided into the left ventricle.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The catheter was then flushed.  LVEDP was measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  The left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of nonionic contrast material.  LVEDP was then remeasured.  Pullback was performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient.  The catheter was then removed.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary was unable to be engaged with this catheter.  Thus it was removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins left #5 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Left main coronary artery was then engaged.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and was removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the right coronary artery and then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Because the patient did have high left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, it was determined that the patient wound need a right heart catheterization.  Thus an #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral vein.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, an #8 French venous sheath was advanced over the guidewire into lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Next, a Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced to the level of 20 cm.  The balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was guided into the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.
